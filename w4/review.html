                <p><em>The Accountant</em> was truly a work of art in my opinion. It was never a movie
                concept that I would've thought of, but I was amazed at every minute detail thatt they managed to
                slip into it. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies, however,
                if you are not fond of blood, stay away.</p>
