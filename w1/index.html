    <h1>Michael Sheehan</h1>

    <p>My name is <strong>Michael Sheehan</strong> and I am in the <i>cyber security program at NEIT</i>. 
        While also partaking in this program and enjoying all my classes, 
        I also work as an EMT. When I graduate I am planning on pursuing a <em>career in 
        emerngcy medicine</em> while at the same time trying to pursue something in cyber security. 
        As normal shifts in emerngcy medicine <u>range from 24 to 48 hours</u>, it alots time for another job!</p>
